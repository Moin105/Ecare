    p1: `Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.`,
    p2: `The first website at CERN – and in the world – was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer. In 2013, CERN launched a project to restore this first ever website: info.cern.ch.`,
    p3: `On 30 April 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain. Later, CERN made a release available with an open licence, a more sure way to maximise its dissemination. These actions allowed the web to flourish.`,
    gits:`About Us`,
    giths:`eCareDocta is a Telemedicine platform committed to improving access to healthcare 
    across Africa.Our primary objective is to bring patients closer to their healthcare providers in a single platform 
    where healthcare services such as online consultations including diagnosis 
    and prescriptions could be offered to patients.
    `,
    nmh:`Our mission`,
    nmp:`eCareDocta strives to solve problems of long waiting times at health facilities, overcrowding at health facilities with a possibility of the increased rate of nosocomial infections due to overcrowding, and bring healthcare to people who for some reasons may not be able to make it to health facilities in time.
    We have not come to take the place of hospitals. Hospitals have their place but Online Consultations have become a necessity. We have come to improve access to healthcare to ensure the African population gets the best possible healthcare from their homes and gets referred to the hospitals when needed.`,
    nmhl:`Our Goal`,
    nmpl:`We are committed to creating a community of individuals living with certain diseases in a common forum where they can interact with specialists in various fields and get tips on improving their quality of life. 
    With carefully selected medical practitioners available to serve patients, we strive to offer healthcare in a holistic approach, leaving nobody behind. 
    Nobody should lose their lives because they could not get access to a healthcare provider, and we are committed to positively impacting the lives of millions of people across Africa.`,
